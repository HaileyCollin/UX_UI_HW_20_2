        <h1 class="display-4">NAMI Responsive Webpage Redesign</h1>
        <p class="lead">Our goal in this project was to give the NAMI Minnesota webpage a much needed tune up. The current look is outdated, unaligned, and overall hard to read .NAMI is a national grassroots organization dedicated to aiding the lives of individuals who personally suffer from mental illness or love someone who does. In this project, we focused on making the Minnesota branch’s website more visually appealing and giving it a more polished look.</p>
        </p>
      </div>

     <div class="headingArea"><a>Project Overview</a>
        <h2>The Idea</h2>
        <p>We like the thought behind NAMI and don’t want to take away from its core values. We wanted to make the website more appealing and easier to read. </p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Challenges we faced were getting in contact with a stakeholder, issues with a huge yet important navigation, and getting ahold of people to interview for the project itself.</p>

    <div class="headingArea"><a>Methodology</a>
        <p>We began by picking up the current website and looking at its other branches in different states, from this, we created a competitor analysis and began creating an interview plan. After interviewing and survey completed, we would move into ideation and from there wireframing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="headingArea"><a>Research</a>
        <p>We conducted the research through interviews, surveys, usability test, and competitor analysis.</p>

They felt passionate about it and really enjoyed being part of something so important.

          <h1 class="display-4">The Problem</h1>
          <p class="lead">Users on the NAMI MN webpage can’t find resources easily and must look through multiple pages to find the resources they are looking for. Users who are trying to find help for themselves or a loved one in a mental crisis are unable to quickly find what they need thus stressing them out further. As a result, users are deterred from using the NAMI MN webpage altogether. How might we make the critical content on the NAMI MN webpage findable?</p>

      </div>

      <div class="jumbotron jumbotron-fluid">
        <div class="container">
          <h1 class="display-4">The Solution</h1>
          <p class="lead">The solution was simple, we needed to take the things we liked from other similar websites we visited and build our own version of it with our own unique style. We didn’t need to change the content of NAMI, just the structure and style of it.</p>

    <div class="headingArea"><a>Testing & Iterating</a>
        <h2>User Testing</h2>
        <p>We tested the Lo-Fi prototype out and people seemed to like the general idea but there was a lot that left users wondering. For example, the layout was confusing without any images or colors and some of the text seemed really jammed in together. Once we got the Hi-Fi done users seemed to enjoy that one a lot. The colors stood out and were alert but not overwhelming and the text seemed easy to read. The new design overall gave people a more user-friendly feel and there weren’t any issues when looking for different resources.</p>
        <h2>Iterations</h2>
        <p>Iterations made for this project were small things like text size, some color choices that were in different areas to make certain text more visible, and the size of images/the image carousel. These small changes helped make the overall design that much more appealing.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="headingArea"><a>The Result</a>
        <p>After everything I am really proud of my team and myself. This was a big project with a lot of different directions to go but I feel we worked wel together and created something wonderful. I got to better my skills in research and components and that will help me greatly in the future.</p>
        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>The next steps to take would be to take on the entire website and not just a few pages and the navigation system then test that and see if results are still successful.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>When I look at this new design I feel excited. I think it turned out beautiful and am proud of myself but most importantly the team and the fact that I was able to be part of it. It was not an easy project by any means but the feeling I have afterwards about it is completely worth it. 

            There are definitely areas for improvement but that isn’t a bad things. I believe a challenging yourself to continue to do better is important and it would be interesting to do it again or go more in depth to see what we would come up with, what would bring this to the next level?
